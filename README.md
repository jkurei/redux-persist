# this is a shitty fork

... of a [great library](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist). do not trust this fork. 

the only difference (for now) is that PersistGate accepts a minimal delay in seconds.

i hate it when a loading screen appears for 100ms and leaves you thinking "did i see something there?". specially for loading screens that are a bit unusual, makes for bad UX.

if you think this is useful, contact me and let's ~~coerce~~Â suggest rt2zz to merge this fork. i plan on doing it anyway, but I may not if I'm the only one using this.
